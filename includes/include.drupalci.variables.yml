# Variables
#
# These variables provide 'Semantic Labels' to help you automatically track the current supported and development versions of Drupal, as well as the current min/max system requirements for PHP, database, etc.
#
# If this file is updated, your testing configuration will automatically follow these changes.
#
# Overriding variables
#   - To override one or more of these variables, simply declare your own variables keyword.
#   - Keywords declared directly in .gitlab-ci.yml take precedence over include files.
#   - Documentation:  https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/

    # Pipeline configuration variables

    # These are the variables provided to the Run Pipeline form that a user may want to override.
    #
    # The defaults are set using 'variables in variables' so that they use semantic labels by default, but can be overriden by the maintainer.
